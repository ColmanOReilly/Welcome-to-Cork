Welcome-to-Cork
===============

This is a simple web site built to show variaus places to Visit in County Cork. The idea of designing and building this site the way I did is outlined in the following information:

Navigation:
I feel that the navigation on this site is self-explanatory and easy to use, providing direct access to various content on this site. I have included the use of site maps at the bottom of each web-page because they provide an alternative method of navigating the site.
I provided a link back to the home-page on every single page by having navigation bar positioned at the top of every page. I felt that this was vital so the users could go back to the start quickly and efficiently eliminating frustration.

Colour Scheme:
The reason that I chose the neutral colours of brown and cream was that I felt that they looked well, gave a warm, tranquil felling to the web-pages and were not distracting of the content. I also choose these colours as they interact well with the content and the images used throughout the web-site. 

Content: 
I believe that the content on the home page is of good quality and is not overloaded vast amounts of information. The user would sooner see interesting, yet short and to the point information rather than long paragraphs of boring content which might turn users off. If they wish to read more about a certain topic, I have provided them with various links to other pages with more content on their chosen topic. 
I feel the attractive graphics add real value to this site because it also shows the user the beauty and wonder of these tourist locations.
